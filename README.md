# Burp Scope Monitor Extension
A Burp Suite Extension to monitor and keep track of tested endpoints.

![](http://g.recordit.co/MwAyLS1VkZ.gif)

Wether you're a bug bounty hunter, pentester or researcher taking a crack at a web app - hopefully this will be useful.

## Main Features

- Simple, easy way to keep track of unique endpoints when testing an application
- Mark individual endpoints as analyzed or not
- Instantly understand when a new endpoint, not tested is requested
- Accessible from Proxy tab (right click, mark request as analyzed/not)
- Send to Repeater convenience
- Enforcment of Burp's in scope rules 
- Import/Export state file directly to a CSV file for
- Autosave option

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Jython configured under Extender -> Options -> Python Environment. For further instructions, check PortSwigger official instructions at their [support page](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1965930-how-to-install-an-extension-in-burp-suite).
2. `git clone git@github.com:Regala/burp-scope-monitor.git`
3. Import [main.py](main.py) in Extender - Extender -> Extensions -> Add -> Select Python -> Select [main.py](main.py)

## Documentation

Most of the options available in General or Import tabs are auto-explanatory. 

- *"Repeater request automatically marks as analyzed"* - when issuing a request to an endpoint from repeater, it marks this request as analyzed automatically.
- *"Color request in Proxy tab"* - this essentially applies the behavior of the extension in the Proxy tab, if you combine these options with "Show only highlighted items" in Proxy. However, it's not as pleasant to the eyes as the color pallete is limited. 
- *"Autosave periodically"* - backups the state file every 10 minutes. When activating this option, consider disabling *"Autostart Scope Monitor"*. This is in order to maintain a different state file per Burp project. However, you can easily maintain only one, master state file.

## Future Development

- Keep track of parameters observed in all requests
- Highlight when a new parameter was used in an already observed/analyzed endpoint
- Export to spreadsheet / Google Sheets
- Adding notes to the endpoint

## Implementation

The code is not yet performant, optimized or anything similar. KISS and it works. Performance will be increased depending on demand and how the extension performs when handling large Burp projects.

To circumvent some of Burp's Extender API limitations, some small hacks were implemented. One of those is automatically setting a comment on the requests that flow in the Proxy tab. You can still add comments on the items, as you'd normally would, but just make sure to keep the placeholder string (`scope-monitor-placeholder`) there. Hopefully in the future each requestResponse from Burp will have a unique identifier, which would make the import state / load from file much cleaner and fast. With large state files, this might hang a bit when loading.
